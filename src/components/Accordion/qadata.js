    {
        id:22,
        question: 'What is Props?',
        answer: 'Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are read-only components which must be kept pure i.e. immutable. They are always passed down from the parent to the child components throughout the application. A child component can never send a prop back to the parent component. This help in maintaining the unidirectional data flow and are generally used to render the dynamically generated data.'
    },
    {
        id:23,
        question: 'State in React?',
        answer: 'States are the heart of React components. States are the source of data and must be kept as simple as possible.

        id:30,
        question: 'Servers',
        answer: 'Servers are the backbone of any back-end development. They work round the clock and aid in delivering essential services such as receiving requests for web-based files and transferring such files to the client. Back-end developers should have knowledge about deploying or hosting servers and be familiar with commonly used servers like Apache, Nginx, IIS servers, and Microsoft IIS. Proficiency of cloud-based platforms such as AWS, Heroku, Google Cloud Platform is a bonus for cracking those server-side interview questions.'
